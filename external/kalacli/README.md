# KalaCLI

This is a cli executable template for C++ 20 on Windows and Linux.

Please be aware that this library/software has limited or no documentation at the current stage due to the KalaKit and the Elypso Engine ecosystem being in early development, if you have questions then message me on discord at @kirjukala
 or via [email](mailto:sanderveski@gmail.com?subject=Questions%20about%20KalaKit%20and%20the%20Elypso%20Engine%20ecosystem). The website linked at the right side also does not currently function because both the domain and its [server backend](https://github.com/kalakit/kalaserver) are still in early development.

This project relies on several [external dependencies](external), this repository [license](LICENSE.md) does not apply to them.

## Projects that use this template

[KalaMake](https://github.com/kalakit/kalamake)

## Minimal compile example

To compile KalaCLI on Windows without Kalamake:
```
//create the root build dir
mkdir build

//create the target binary dir
mkdir build\release-windows

//create the object dir
mkdir build\release-windows\obj

//go to the target binary dir
cd build\release-windows

//compile cpp files
for /r "..\..\src" %f in (*.cpp) do clang++ -DLIB_STATIC -std=c++20 -c "%f" -I"..\..\include" -I"..\..\..\external-shared\KalaHeaders\include" -o "obj\%~nf.obj"

//link into library
llvm-lib /OUT:kalacli.lib "obj\*.obj"
```
And on Linux:
```
//create the root build dir
mkdir build

//create the target binary dir
mkdir build\release-linux

//create the object dir
mkdir build\release-linux\obj

//go to the target binary dir
cd build\release-linux

//compile cpp files
for f in ../../src/**/*.cpp
    clang++ -DLIB_STATIC -std=c++20 -c "$f" -I"../../include" -I"../../../external-shared/KalaHeaders/include" -o obj/(basename $f .cpp).o
end

//link into library
ar rcs libkalacli.a obj/*.o
```
