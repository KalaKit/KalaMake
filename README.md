# KalaMake

**KalaMake** is an executable that uses `.kma` files that are designed as an alternative to CMake, Make and others of its kind with its own custom DSL and a simple CLI to compile libraries and software.

This cli was built with the help of the [KalaCLI](https://github.com/kalakit/kalacli) library.
